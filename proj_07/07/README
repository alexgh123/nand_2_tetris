Hello!

This is the README for project 7 of the nand2tetris course (http://nand2tetris.org/).

How to compile and run:
  - The 'driver' of the program is VMtoMnemonics.py. Start there to read and understand the code.
  - At the bottom of the VMtoMnemonics.py file, a 'target' variable is set.
    - If you wish to compile your own file, you will need to change the value of 'target' to the file you wish to
      translate.
  - To run (read all steps before execution):
    - assumption: you have python 3.5 or later installed. (required for the pathlib library)
    - change the name of the 'target' variable in VMtoMnemonics.py.
    - remove any identation and lines associated with the line 'if __name__=='main'...'
    - navigage to the  'hardt07' directory (parent directory of VMtoMnemonics.py)
    - type $> python VMtoMnemonics.py
    - The program will find the '.vm' file in the source directory and translate it to a '.asm' file in the same
      directory.
    - There are commented out example 'target'(s) so it is more clear how to change that value.
